# [LEGACY VERSION]
## Hue-saturation-value based segmentation: see 'main' branch for edge detection algorithm

## Interfacial Dewetting and Drainage Optical Platform (i-DDrOP)

i-DDrOP analysis of thin film dewetting patterns in videos using hydrophilic glass domes with lubricin/water as base media. 

Includes two main code files:
- *Video processing*: outputs a file containing the film's wet area for every time point.
- *Data analysis*: calculates dewetting onset time for a thin film, given a file containing wet area vs time information.

Matlab scripts (*.m*) are included along with respective helper function folders. Contact Vincent Xia (vxia@stanford.edu) with questions.
